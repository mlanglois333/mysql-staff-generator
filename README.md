Node/Mysql Staff Database

This is an ap using NodeJs and Mysql that allows users to create, review, update, and delete employee data held in a database. It works by establishing a connection to the database then using input from inquirer prompts to manipulate data within the tables. Don't forget to use npm install and run the sql data before using!
