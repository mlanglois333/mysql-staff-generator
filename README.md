# Node/Mysql Staff Database

This application allows users to create, review, update, and delete employee data held in a database!

It uses a mySql database and raw queries to manipulate the data within the tables without the use of an ORM.
This is a Node application that uses the Inquirer package to gather the user-inputted data.
